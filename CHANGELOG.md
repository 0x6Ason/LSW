# Changelog

## 1.0.0-beta.1

- Added the `lsw` Unix-host CLI with default-instance shell, `exec`, `run`,
  status, stop, push, and pull commands.
- Added `lswd`, a private Unix-socket daemon that supervises QEMU and swtpm,
  reconciles state through QMP, and handles graceful or forced shutdown.
- Added a dependency-free, authenticated Windows x64 guest agent with concurrent
  process sessions and binary-safe file transfer.
- Added guided and explicitly destructive unattended Windows Setup seeds. The
  generated answer file contains no product key, activation bypass, OOBE bypass,
  or preactivated image.
- Added standard, slim, ephemeral-overlay, and Secure Boot profiles. All beta
  profiles preserve Windows servicing components.
- Added KVM/TCG planning, private OVMF variable stores, vTPM, inbox Windows NVMe,
  e1000e and VGA devices, loopback-only agent forwarding, and Unix-socket VNC for
  installation or recovery.
- Added a reproducible Zig-backed Windows agent cross-build and Linux x86_64
  release-bundle scripts.
- Licensed LSW under `GPL-3.0-or-later`; binary bundles include the exact
  corresponding source and build scripts.

Known limitations are tracked in `docs/BETA.md`.
